# Node Cluster Module

- Clusters of Node.js processes can be used to run multiple instances of Node.js that can distribute workloads among their application threads. When process isolation is not needed, use the worker_threads module instead, which allows running multiple application threads within a single Node.js instance.

- The cluster module allows easy creation of child processes that all share server ports.
